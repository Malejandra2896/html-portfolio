<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Maria, a social worker that began this programming journey as a "side hustle" but little by little it became her permanent job
  making real the dream of working from home to minimize time spending burdens such as commutes, traffic and wasting money.
</p>

<p>This is my first portfalio learning stuff as a programmer, I hope you enjoy this step by step
  journey with and be happy but also suffer with me at the same time.
</p>

<p>Â¡ENJOY!</p>
